# Groceries (Re)Cycle - FoodApp

This repository contains the code of the **Groceries (Re)Cycle** app.

This app is developed with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

You can use this app to:
 - Keep a virtual copy of your fridge
 - Search for recipes (based on keywords or on ingredients contained in your fridge)
 - Handle your groceries
 
The app is leveraging [OpenFactFood](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) in order to look for products (along with 
their [nutri-score](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore)) based on ingredients.

To learn more about the features of this application you can check the repository of the backend: [FoodAPI](https://github.com/PaulPidou/FoodAPI).
